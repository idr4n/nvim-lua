# Neovim Configuration

This is my Neovim configuation written in Lua (wip).

## Basic setup

- **Preferred themes (wip)**: I often prefer monotone themes such as [nvim-noirbuddy - slate](https://github.com/jesseleite/nvim-noirbuddy) or Zenbones. However, sometimes I use more colorful ones like [dracula.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/dracula.nvim) and [nord.nvim](https://github.com/gbprod/nord.nvim).
- **Terminals**: Alacritty, WezTerm or Kitty. To check my terminals configuration, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles) and my [WezTerm configuration](https://github.com/idr4n/wezterm).
- **Font**: I have been switching back and forth between [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/); however, I have recently settled on a customized version of Iosevka based on Zed Mono.
- I'm using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as my package manager, which allows me to start Neovim in around 50ms⚡️.
