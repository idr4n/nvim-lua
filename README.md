# Neovim Configuration

This is my Neovim configuation written in Lua.

## Basic setup

- **Preferred themes**: [dracula.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/dracula.nvim), and [nord.nvim](https://github.com/gbprod/nord.nvim).
- **Terminals**: WezTerm (alternatively Alacritty and Kitty). To check my terminals configuration, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles) and my [WezTerm configuration](https://github.com/idr4n/wezterm).
- **Font**: I switch back and forth between [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/).
- I'm using **[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as my package manager**, which allows me to start Neovim in around 30ms⚡️.
