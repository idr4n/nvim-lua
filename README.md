# Neovim Configuration

This is my Neovim configuation written in Lua (wip).

## Basic setup

- **Preferred themes (wip)**: I like monotone themes so I decided to make my own based on VSCode and Zed' Github Light Monochrome themes. üé® Here it is: [idr4n/github-monochrome.nvim](https://github.com/idr4n/github-monochrome.nvim). For more colorful ones, I use [dracula.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/dracula.nvim) and [folke/tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
- **Terminals**: Ghostty, Alacritty, WezTerm or Kitty. To check my terminals configuration, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles) and my [WezTerm configuration](https://github.com/idr4n/wezterm).
- **Font**: I switch back and forth between [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/); however, I have settled on Zed Plex Mono, the default font of the [Zed Editor](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed).
- I'm using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as my package manager with a Neovim startup time of around 45ms‚ö°Ô∏è.
